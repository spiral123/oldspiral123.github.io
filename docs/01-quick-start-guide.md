BestRoute is an app that helps you Plan, Optimize and Navigation multi-stop routes quickly and easily.

## Plan

get your waypoints in

[^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ "/docs/structure/" | absolute_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.

**ProTip:** enter tons of addresses in random order

### Optimize

Optimize your route as a *round trip* or *A - B* route.

### Go

BestRoute will estimate how long it takes to get between your stops.  As you mark a stop as complete it will recalculate the time for the remaining stops based on what the current time is.
