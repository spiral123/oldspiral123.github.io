================

**The threat of a major volcanic eruption at Mount Agung is already having a negative effect on Bali's most important industry - tourism.**

The fear of an eruption has forced the evacuation of 40,000 people from the volcano's foothills.
It has also forced the temporary closure of Bali's main airport until at least Tuesday morning.
Tourism numbers have been down since the volcano began rumbling in September.
"We are very well prepared but we do need to worry about the long-term impact on the lives of the evacuees and the impact on tourism to Bali. That's the more serious issue," said Bali's Governor, Made Pastika.
